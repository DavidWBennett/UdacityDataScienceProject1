# UdacityDataScienceProject1
This is my Project 1 Work for the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree

This project analyzes the [Seattle AirBnB](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle) dataset found on Kaggle.

Three questions were presented and then answered:
-- Do rooms get booked more frequently on the weekends?
-- Do rooms that mention the word 'view' in their description charge more?
-- Are guests more likely to review if they want to give a very good or very poor review?

Only standard libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and zipfile are required.
