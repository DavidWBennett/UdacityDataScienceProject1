# UdacityDataScienceProject1
This is my Project 1 Work for the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree.

This project analyzes the [Seattle AirBnB](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle) dataset found on Kaggle.
Only standard libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and zipfile are required.

Three questions were presented and then answered:
1. Do rooms get booked more frequently on the weekends?
2. Do rooms that mention the word 'view' in their description charge more?
3. Are guests more likely to review if they want to give a very good or very poor review?
